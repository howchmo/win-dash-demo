# Windows WebM Live Streaming Using Dash.js and ffmpeg

Adapted the [Instructions to do WebM live streaming via DASH](http://wiki.webmproject.org/adaptive-streaming/instructions-to-do-webm-live-streaming-via-dash) at the [WebM Project Wiki](http://wiki.webmproject.org/) to do live streaming on Windows.  This requires the installation of [screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free) which can be dowloaded from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/screencapturer/files).

**NOTE:** *This currently does not encode audio. The intent is to simplify the code down to just work with video streams.*
